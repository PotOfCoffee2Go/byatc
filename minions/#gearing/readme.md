Gearing -

1:  the act or process of providing or fitting with gears

2:  the parts by which motion is transmitted from one portion of machinery to another; especially :  a train of gears
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\(Merriam-Webster.com - <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gearing" target="_blank">gearing</a>\)

Many of the gears, sprockets, parts, and machinery of the minions are the same. The #gearing directory contains the code that implements those common devices.
