Byatec was made in concert with [Onyx & Breezy Foundation](http://www.onyxandbreezy.org/) created by Wanda
and Mark Shefts to cherish the memory of Onyx and Breezy to benefit the welfare of animals. All activities
are volunteer, guaranteeing 100% of contributions go to fulfill the goals of the Foundation dedicated 
to rescue animals from kill shelters; provide food, medicine and supplies; support foster groups and 
sanctuaries; as well as assisting individuals where medical hardship is present.

Yearly, the Foundation has a Gala Event to increase awareness to the needs of animals. During the event,
items donated to the Foundation are put up for auction. Items in the past range from limited edition artwork,
a 'Signed Jack Nicklaus Masters Golf Tournament Scorecard', to a 'Pink Icing Cup Cake Microbead Pillow'!

The Foundation is building a mobile-ready online auction system to be used during this 
year's Event. If you wish to watch the project as it is being built you can visit 
[Oynx and Breezy Auction Development](https://trello.com/b/RpqBtWv2/onyx-and-breezy-auction-development) which
which is updated weekly with the tasks as they are being ( or not being ;) done.

For those interested (or wishing to contribute) to the code being written - visit the GitHub repository 
[byatec](https://github.com/PotOfCoffee2Go/byatc). The server side code-base is expected to 
be completed by May 1st, 2017 - at which time the REST API and WebSocket documentation for front-end development
to the auction will be available.
